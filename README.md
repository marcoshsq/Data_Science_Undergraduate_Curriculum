## About me and this repository.

Hi, my name is Marcos Henrique, I'm interested in becoming a data scientist. But unfortunately, a proper college degree is quite expensive, and I'm not able to afford one at the moment, so, after researching different materials on the internet, roadmaps, YouTube videos, guides, articles, and different curriculums of university courses for bachelor in data science and statistics, I've decided to create my own curriculum with free materials.

This repository is a record of my studies, here are the courses I took, the order I followed, the certificates I got and the projects I developed.

About the structure of this repository. It's divided into three parts. ``Roadmap``, ``List of Courses and books`` and ``Projects``.

In the ``Roadmap`` section, the name gives the prize, it is the order in which I studied the courses. In the ``List of Courses and books`` section, I have listed all the relevant materials, courses, books and articles that I've studied. At last, most of the courses have capstone/guided projects, that are developed during the course. These projects are listed in the ``Projects`` section, at the end of this repository.

About the courses I chose. I know that Data Science is divided into four pillars: ``Mathematics`` (AKA Statistics), ``Technology``, ``Domain Knowledge``, and ``Soft Skills``. My main focus here is Math and tech, as they are the longest part of the curriculum, I've searched for good Soft skills courses, and included some here, but for me, this kind of knowledge is only acquired by doing it. And different from programming, where you can learn to code in your house practicing, you won't learn how to publicly speak... well, without public speaking! But I included the ones I thought will help me develop some crucial knowledge.

The main guides I've followed to create this curriculum can be found in the ``References`` section, at the end of this ``README`` page.

## Roadmap.

### Year 01.

After all, What is Data Science?

Everyone just talks about it, and is it even the sexiest job? Now, seriously. This year's goal is to master the basics.

I have a degree in civil engineering, so subjects like calculus, linear algebra, and matrices will be more of a review for me than actually learning them from scratch (nice). Another positive point is that I taught programming classes during university, so even though I don't have a deep knowledge of computer science, these basic concepts won't be difficult to master.

By the end of year one, my goal is: if someone asks me what data science is, I can answer with the propriety of someone who knows what they're talking about!
