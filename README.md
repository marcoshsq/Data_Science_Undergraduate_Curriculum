## About me and this repository.

Hi, my name is Marcos Henrique, I'm interested in becoming a data scientist. But unfortunately, a proper college degree is quite expensive, and I'm not able to afford one at the moment, so, after researching different materials on the internet, roadmaps, YouTube videos, guides, articles, and different curriculums of university courses for bachelor in data science and statistics, I've decided to create my own curriculum with free materials.

This repository is a record of my studies, here are the courses I took, the order I followed, the certificates I got and the projects I developed.

About the structure of this repository. It's divided into three parts. ``Roadmap``, ``Projects`` and ``References``.

In the ``Roadmap`` section, the name gives the prize, it is the order in which I studied the courses. I've also listed all the relevant materials, courses, books, and articles that I've studied. At last, most of the courses have capstone/guided projects. These projects are listed in the ``Projects`` section, at the end of this repository.

About the courses I chose. I know that Data Science is divided into four pillars: ``Mathematics`` (AKA Statistics), ``Technology``, ``Domain Knowledge``, and ``Soft Skills``. My main focus here is Math and tech, as they are the longest part of the curriculum, I've searched for good Soft skills courses, and included some here, but for me, this kind of knowledge is only acquired by doing it. And different from programming, where you can learn to code in your house practicing, you won't learn how to publicly speak... well, without public speaking! But I included the ones I thought will help me develop some crucial knowledge.

The main guides I've followed to create this curriculum can be found in the ``References`` section, at the end of this ``README`` page.

## Roadmap.
<!-- 
Part 01 - contexto.
-->
### Part 01 - Fundamentals.

***The way of the programmer!***

Here's the funny thing about getting a junior data science job... You don't get it! The truth is, that there isn't a junior data science position, so, my goal in the first two parts of this roadmap is to land a Junior Data Analyst position.

So, looking through my background, I have a major in Civil engineering, beyond that, I've also taught programming classes during my time at university. This means I have a very good base in Mathematics, some knowledge of programming logic, and a little background in the IT field, so I'll not start from zero, which is pretty good.

So my main focus in this first part (and part 02 as well), is to review some math concepts (Such as Linear Algebra, Matrices, and Discrete Mathematics). Also want to focus on programming.
