## About.

This is a curated list of free courses from reputable universities like MIT, Stanford, and Johns Hopkins University that satisfy the same requirements as an undergraduate curriculum for Data Science, minus general education.

To build this curriculum I've consulted different sources which can be found in the ``References`` section at the end of this ``README`` page.

## Main Curriculum.

Work in progress... 

### Introduction:

This first section is an introduction to the area of data science and some tools used, my objective is to understand what data science is, where it is applied and what are their methodologies.

This first specialization offered by IBM has ten courses, with around 200 hours to complete. In addition to offering an excellent high-level overview of the field of Data Science, it also introduced some tools like ``Github``, ``Python``, and some libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib e etc.), ``Jupyter notebooks``, ``SQL``, and some more concepts like ``Machine Learning``, ``Deep Learning``.

It was a great introductory course. And below is the link to my certificate of completion, and also the link to the repository with the projects developed.

This second specialization offered by Johns Hopkins University is a more “punk” version of the previous one, with a greater focus on math, especially statistics. This specialization is longer, with around 300 hours to complete, and among the skills taught are ``Data Manipulation``, ``R Programming``, ``Regression Analysis``, ``Cluster Analysis``, ``Data Cleansing``, ``Rstudio``, and etc.

And to finish off the introduction, let's focus on the tools. The following two specializations have nine courses totaling about 230 total hours, focusing on Python for Data Science and SQL. 

The Applied Data Science with Python specialization is offered by the University of Michigan and teaches things like ``NLTK``, ``Python Text Mining``, ``Pandas``, ``Matplotlib``, ``Numpy``, ``Python Data Cleansing``, ``Data Virtualization``, ``Scikit-Learn``, and more.

While the Learn SQL Basics for Data Science specialization introduces concepts such as ``Apache Spark``, ``Delta Lake``, ``SQL``, ``A/B Testing``, ``Query String``, ``Predictive Analytics`` and a few more things.

[Learn SQL Basics for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science) | --- | ---

Wow, quite a lot, and this was just the introduction, by my count this beginning has about 700~800 hours of content. But that's about it, Data Science is a very demanding area, and I haven't even gotten into Mathematics yet.

But concluding the intro section, my goal was to learn the basics of the field, its applications, and tools, and I believe that these courses, 29 in total, helped me with that.

So, let's go to part two. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

### Part 02 - Databases:

From this section I will divide the curriculum into two fronts, one with general concepts and the other with specific concepts. While for this part the general concepts will be about Computer Science and Mathematics, the specific content will be about Databases.

#### Mathematics:

They say the hardest part in Data Science is math, but here's the fun part (for me), I'm a Bachelor of Civil Engineering and Statistics so I don't need to learn math for data science from scratch, isn't that amazing! (o^▽^o) ＼(^ω^＼): ヽ(o＾▽＾o)ノ: (✯◡✯) (* ^ ω ^): (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ: (◕‿◕)

Therefore, my math studies will be more focused on computational applications, modeling, and applied statistics in DS.

[Applied Calculus with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-calculus-with-python) | --- | ---

#### Computer Science:

These three courses offered by Princeton University, totaling about 140 hours of class, focus on developing skills in ``algorithms`` and ``data structures``.
